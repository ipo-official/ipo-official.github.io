DevLog #0 - 07/12/21

Hello guys, I don't know if anyone will see this but, welcome to my devlog.

So, I'm working on Symple Code, a compiler for a language similar to C; I want it to feel like C# (cs) with low-level design from C++ (cpp), and a little bit of my style salted in. I plan to use pointers, although in `volatile` code, basically unsafe context. Refences will also be implemented, C library importing, obviosly, as well as most core cs/cpp features. Properties will exist, as well as a fellow dear `->` (arrow) operator, this will allow the user to make a custom function for the right side, ie:
```
	float operator ->GudNumber(String) =>
		ret 6.9;

	"Actual"->GudNumber; // <-- will return 6.9
```

...maybe even add a `.` (dot) operator in volatile context. I also plan to have `industry prefrences`, basically if your working at an industry and you want everything to be private, const, etc. by default; I'll have an option for that; if you're the kind of guy who wants it easy, type less, everything public, mutable, volatile, you name it! We got you covered.

Moving towards the present, welcome to my 5th iteration of syc (Symple Code), I always end up quiting when I try to implement structs. But fear not fellow friend, for I have a secret weapon up my sleave, 2 actually:
	1) I'm making it in cs instead of cpp
	2) I'm usinng LLVM now

This is an advantage for 1: cs helps me thing more high-level (duh), and 2: LLVM is an amazing library, it makes codegen easier and just all the nitty-gritty stuff like types and cross-platform; if you don't already use LLVM for making languages, do so, please.

All in all, thanks for comming and enjoying my first ever devlog, catch you in the next one; and until then: Cheers!
