Devlog #5 - 09/24/21
---

School. I have not worked on syc much, but it is now at its 5th iteration (woohoo!). I'm taking a new approuch, but things are going slowly cuz my schedule is packed. I haven't devlogged in a month, so hi! Not much has changed, again, my schedule is packed. I will still work on syc sometimes, but expect slow work from now on. Smell ya later :)
