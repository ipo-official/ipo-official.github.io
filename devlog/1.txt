DevLog #1 - 07/12/21
---

So I didn't work on syc today, but I did make the amazing website you're using right this instant, and moved some of my games here. Hope you don't mind.

I had some trouble thinking of the name for the website, and after some consideration, I chose `supafuntime`. Because you, my dear friend, shall have a fun time on my website. Also, I want more people looking at my devlogs, so that means: Advertizement! How do I do self-promotion? Well, good question! I don't really know the answer. But, I can do some ploting:

	1) YouTube
		- I can maybe post devlogs on yotube or just big updates or promotions.

	2) The InterWebz
		- The internet is a big place, I can try using discord and other social media platforms for promotion.

	3) Hope and Wait
		- Eventually, people will checkout my site, when they do, it will be like a dominoe effect; one person will share to another and another. The only problem is that I I need to be very lucky to have someone just go on github and see my website.

Anyways, I think that's enough for today, don't forget to checkout Symple Code at <a href="https://github.com/SympleLib/SympleCode">https://github.com/SympleLib/SympleCode</a> ðŸ˜‰
Hey, I need all the promotion I can get.
